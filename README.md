# Controlling_System_Volume
In this project, we have tried to control our PC/Laptop's volume by hand gestures using the web-cam.
In order to achieve this, firstly we need python idle on our system and there should be web-cam present on our system.
After installing idle on our system, we need to create the virtual environment so as to import all the necessary modules required for this project to work such as cv2, mediapipe, AudioUtilities, etc.
After installing all the necessary modules, we will execute the the two file namely volume_control.py and handtracking.py .
Then the code will access the system's web-cam and a window will be opened that will be accessing our hand gestures.
Using the hand gestures we would be able to adjust the system's volume.
